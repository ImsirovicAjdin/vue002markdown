            (1) Now that we know that text interpolation can't render HTML for security reasons, 
            we'll render dynamic HTML with the V-HTML directive. Like the V-MODEL, this one is a 
            special attribute that adds a new feature to our template: it RENDERS any VALID HTML STRING
            into our app. Just pass the string as the value:

            (2)
            It is not recommended to use V-HTML on content created by the users of the application. 
            They could write malicious JavaScript code inside a <script> tag that would be executed.
            However, with normal text interpolation, you're safe because the HTML tags are escaped.

            <!-- 
            (3) Note that we have removed the previous text interpolation of notePreview:
            {{ notePreview }}
            -->
            <!-- 
            (4) Note: Any content inside our aside element will be replaced by the value of the V-HTML 
            directive. You can use this to put placeholder contents inside.
            -->
            <!-- 
            (5) Note: There is an equivalent directive for text interpolation, V-TEXT, which behaves
            like V-HTML, but escapes the HTML tags just like classic text interpolations.
